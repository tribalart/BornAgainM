This project is a WIP personal learning project with MelonLoader (https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) developed in collaboration with some AIs, because I don’t know how to code at all. 
It is certainly full of flawed logic and obvious mistakes.

I did not modify any game data; I am only reading different values to display online players, HP, stats,
and to swap item slots for bank sorting.

I do not intend to break the game, affect players’ journeys, or gain any unfair advantage. I am simply using BornAgain as a theme because I am enjoying the game at the moment. Thank you.
